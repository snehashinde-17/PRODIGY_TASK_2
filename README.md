# Image Encryption Tool

## Overview

The **Image Encryption Tool** is a Python-based application designed to secure images by encrypting them with a robust encryption algorithm. This tool allows users to safeguard sensitive visual information, ensuring that images can only be accessed or viewed by authorized individuals with the correct decryption key. It is an ideal solution for privacy-conscious individuals, businesses, or organizations that handle confidential or sensitive images.

## Features

- **Encryption of Images**: This tool enables users to encrypt images with a secure algorithm, rendering them unreadable to unauthorized parties.
- **Decryption**: Encrypted images can be decrypted back to their original state by providing the correct decryption key.
- **Command Line Interface**: Easy-to-use command line interface for performing encryption and decryption operations.
- **Support for Various Image Formats**: The tool supports multiple image formats such as PNG, JPEG, BMP, and TIFF.
- **Custom Key Length**: Users can define the key length for encryption, allowing for flexibility in security levels.
- **Fast Processing**: Optimized for efficient and fast image encryption and decryption, even for large files.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Runs on any system that supports Python, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative error messages when issues such as invalid files, incorrect keys, or unsupported formats are encountered.

## Use Cases

- **Data Privacy**: Protect sensitive images such as personal photos, scanned documents, or proprietary designs.
- **Secure Image Transmission**: Ensure images sent over insecure channels remain protected from unauthorized access.
- **Research & Development**: Encrypt research images, designs, or other critical visual information to prevent data leaks.
- **Corporate Security**: Safeguard company logos, brand assets, and sensitive corporate imagery from misuse.

## How It Works

1. **Encryption**: 
   - The tool applies a strong encryption algorithm to transform the image into an unreadable format.
   - Users can specify a custom encryption key that enhances security.
   - The encrypted file can be stored or shared securely.

2. **Decryption**:
   - To restore the image, users input the encryption key used during encryption.
   - The tool decrypts the file back into its original image format.
   
3. **Command Line Interface**:
   - The tool can be operated via simple command line commands to perform encryption and decryption. Users can pass in image paths and keys through arguments.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: 
  - Pillow (for image processing)
  - Cryptography (for encryption and decryption)
  
You can install these dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
